<p>Jason Fulford's photographs – Giancarlo De Carlo in Urbino<br> "Italo Calvino had come to Urbino and slept at the Collegio del Colle. [...] he had told me that he had liked everything very much, but what he had liked most was that in that Collegio one could go out in the morning because he has to meet a girl he likes. And so he begins to follow a path; however, at a certain point, the path branches off and then branches off again, and it goes up and down and obliquely and offers more and more choices; until you come to a final crossroads where you meet another girl who you like even more and you forget about the first one: your life changes and the cause is architecture."
